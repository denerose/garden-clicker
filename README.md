# garden-clicker

Garden Clicker was my first game project. Made two weeks after first picking up GDScript and Godot and my first time coding anything after almost 20 years. 

This game is not fun. It's incredibly basic but I'm proud of completing it and the fact it works and does everything I set out to make it do. Revealed here to show progress rather than as an example of current skill level.
